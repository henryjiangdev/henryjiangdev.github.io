Combining data-driven insights with business knowledge, you will design RnP programs to optimize and improve the customer experience, and partnering closely with regional business units, operations, and product management teams to develop and implement them globally. | You will have the opportunity - and challenge - to constantly improve and adapt solutions to the fast-changing face of online commerce, analyze information and exercise solid judgement to bring it all together, and make a tangible difference in PayPal’s business results. While the end objectives will be clear, the path to achieve it will challenge you to constantly innovate. | If your skill sets match the role, you can be assured of a fulfilling career with overwhelming opportunities to learn, grow and succeed in one of the fastest growing industries in the world. | Qualifications: | Strong Analytical skills | Good understanding of payment infrastructure | Knowledge of SAS, SQL recommended | We're a purpose-driven company whose beliefs are the foundation for how we conduct business every day.
