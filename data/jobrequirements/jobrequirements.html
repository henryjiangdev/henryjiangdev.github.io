<td>*This is a remote 10-week paid summer fellowship.*About Murmuration/What We DoMurmuration is a political strategy organization that is transforming the politics of education so that every child can benefit from equal access to equitable and high-quality public schools.We empower campaigns, advocates, and organizers to better engage and mobilize communities to demand improvements to the public education system. We advise and support our partners in their efforts to plan and execute successful, data-driven electoral, organizing, and advocacy campaigns so that together we can transform the politics of education. And, we build political influence, craft strategies, leverage data and develop technology that enable our partners to accelerate progress, particularly those in traditionally marginalized communities.Who We AreOur team includes experts and innovators in data, analytics, and strategy.

We are focused on transforming the politics of education - partnering with organizations across the country committed to organizing parents and communities around the issues of public education and educational equity, electing to office and holding accountable local leaders who will make improving public K-12 schools a priority, and advocating for policy changes with the goal of improving outcomes for children. To do this, we believe that it is critical that all of the political stakeholders- electoral organizations, advocacy and organizing groups, charter associations, networks of schools, districts, elected officials, and voters - to contribute to a strong and politically savvy education sector that works together toward a common vision of improving public education.About the FellowshipThe Murmuration Summer Fellowship provides fellows with the unique opportunity to work closely with Murmuration teams on summer projects, while contributing to Murmuration’s mission of transforming the politics of education so that every child can benefit from equal access to equitable and high-quality public schools.Fellows will have meaningful, productive, and engaging summer experiences, as they learn and grow with a cohort of peers.
